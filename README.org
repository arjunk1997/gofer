* pugofer
This is a fork of Rustom Mody's fork of Mark Jones' original.
I've only made a few changes to make the build pass on macOS.

* Changes vs pugofer
It seems macOS adheres to POSIX specifications more strictly than most Linux distros do.
As a result, the legacy `termio.h` header (from System V), included in most Linux distros, is no longer included in macOS. As a result, pugofer fails
to build on macOS. 
For Apple systems, I've replaced `termio.h` with `termios.h`, its succesor. And a bunch of macros have been updated/replaced.

* Setup
See [[file:INSTALL.org][installation/setup]]
